This is the source code for the Player Tweak mutator tutorial found at:

http://www.moddb.com/groups/31/unreal-tournament-3-developers/tutorials/24645/unreal-learning-2-ut3-configurable-mutators

You should note that the package file contains slightly different UI Scenes from the tutorial; this is not overly important as  the scene is largely the same.

There are two UIScenes in the package. The correct file is PlayerTweakConfigMenu; the other is an older scene that was used as a testbed during development and could not be removed due to UnrealEd referencing.

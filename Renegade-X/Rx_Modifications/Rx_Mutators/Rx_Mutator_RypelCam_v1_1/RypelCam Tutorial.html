	<a href="javascript:ShowHide('WhatisRypelcamSubDiv')">What is RypelCam ?</a>
	<div id="WhatisRypelcamSubDiv" style="display: block;">
    The objective of RypelCam is to improve and enhance the playback of 
Ren-X replays (a.k.a. 'demos'), while giving special attention to features for movie makers.
    A virtual camera provides the opportunity to create stunning 
cinematic sequences on its way along a user-constructed path. <br>RypelCam was first introduced in 2005 for Unreal Engine 1 by RypeL, who later became
		the lead programmer on Ren-X. UE2 and UE3 versions were then developed aswell and were used in gametrailes and countless fraggmovies, especially for UT2004. VegasKill and RattleSN4K3 later contributed to the UE3 version aswell wich then got adapted and modified to become the Ren-X version, managed and maintained again by RypeL.

<li>
<a href="javascript:ShowHide('InstallationDiv')">Installation</a>
<div id="InstallationDiv" style="display: block;">
	<ul>
	<li>
1.1 : <em>Renegade X/UDKGame/CookedPC</em> : copy <strong>RenX_RCam_StandAlone.u</strong> into this folder</li>
	<li>
1.2 : <em>Renegade X/UDKGame/Config/UDKGame.ini</em> :<br>
<table style="font-size:14px;" align="center" border="0">
  <tbody><tr><td align="right">Find:</td><td><pre>	DecalManagerClassPath=Engine.DecalManager</pre>	</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">Replace with:</td><td><pre>	DecalManagerClassPath=RenX_RCam_StandAlone.RCamDecalManager</pre></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

    
    
    </li>
    <li>
1.3 : RypelCam uses some keys on your keyboard by default, a keybind overview is included at the end of this tutorial. <br>
Normally, userdefined keybinds are not active during demo playback, 
therefore they will not conflict with RypelCam. You may remove keybinds 
that interfere your work if they are executed in addition to the 
RypelCam keybinds. It is for example reccomended to unbind the arrow 
keys (input options in the Ren-X menu) to avoid camera shakes.
	</li>
    <li>
1.4 : For the best recording performance,  the game frames per second 
should be set equal to the recording frames per second: set the 
'MaxSmoothedFrameRate' to the desired value and 'bSmoothFrameRate=True' 
in the UTEngine.ini file.
	</li>
	</ul>

</div> <!-- end InstallationDiv-->
</li>



<li>
<a href="javascript:ShowHide('BasicsDiv')">Basics</a>
<div id="BasicsDiv" style="display: none;">
	<ul>
	<li>
2.1 : If youÂ´ve done the steps in Chapter 1 correctly RypelCam should automatically load at demostart.<br>- Press Mouse1 to cycle through players (X+Mouse1 to cycle backwards)<br>- Press right control to toggle between first-/thirdperson.
	</li>
	<li>
2.2 : Then you should get yourself familiar with the spectatorcam. To
view it either hit the right mousebutton or the 'k' key. The difference 
is that the right mousebutton will teleport the speccam to your current 
location unlike the 'k' key, which will teleport you to the speccam 
instead(and 'k' doesent work in some situations). Then you can fly 
around with it using the 'w,a,s,d,space,c' keys. Note that 'spacebar' is
 occupied by a keybind from Epic and unpauses the demo. In exchange, 
'shift,leftalt' can be used to change the altitude while paused. You can
 pause the demo with the 'DownArrow' key. 
'1' to '9'  change the camera speed, the 'Numpad1/Numpad2' keys slow 
down or accelerate the camera smoothly.
	</li>
    <li>
2.3 : Basic Democontrols:
You can change the demo speed with the 'LeftArrow' and 'RightArrow' keys
 or the 'Mousescrollwheel'. Hitting the 'UpArrow' restores the normal 
playback speed.
While being in the 3rd person view, the 'L' key locks the 
viewingdirection of the player your currently watching (only in 
serverside demos).
	</li>
    <li>
2.4 : If you want to make Camerapaths you first need to know what a 
Campoint is. Campoints are RypelCam's "keypoints" that you place in the 
map to define the way your Camera should take. The Cam will fly through 
all the Campoints and will compute a smooth path between them. A 
Campoint contains the coordinates for its location, the field of view 
and rotation and finally the Campoint's creation time for fully 
automatic camera drives. However, the 'timed paths' are optional and you
 are free to control the camera speed manually. You can read more about 
timing in chapter 4. 
	</li>
    <li>
2.5 : To make a Campath you have to create at least 4 Campoints. To 
create a Campoint fly with the speccam to a point in the map where you 
want to set a Campoint and then hit 'Numpad5'.
This already completes a basic Campath.
	</li>
    <li>
2.6 : After you have placed at least 4 Campoints you can make the Cam 
travel along the camera path by hitting the 'Numpad3' key. '1-9' and 
'Numpad1/2' keys can be used to control its speed. You can switch the 
cam path's visibility with the 'Numpad9' key. It will cycle through 3 
different draw modes(everything invisible, everything visible, only 
Campoints but not the path between them visible).
You can create up to 120 Campoints and remove the final Campoint with 
'Numpad4'.
	</li>
    <li>
2.7 : It can happen that RypelCam doesent allow the creation of a new 
Campoint, sending a warning message in the console. This happens when 
you try to create a Campoint that is too close or too far away from the 
previous Campoint. "Too close" or "too far away" mean that the widest 
distance between 2 Campoints is greater than 15 times the shortest 
distance between 2 Campoints in your path.
	</li>
	</ul>

<li>
<a href="javascript:ShowHide('SavingandloadingDiv')">Saving &amp; loading</a>
<div id="SavingandloadingDiv" style="display: none;">
	<ul>
	<li>
3.1 : You can save a Campath with 'F6'. And you can load a Campath with
'F8'. Campaths are saved in a automatically created UTRypelCam.ini, which can only store 1
Campath. If you want to store multiple Campaths or different versions of
 your Campaths you can make copies of the UTRypelCam.ini. 
	</li>
	<li>
3.2 : In the UTRypelCam.ini you can also see the saved values of a 
Campath. If you think you know what youre doing and if you want to make 
small adjustments you could do that right in the ini.
	</li>
	</ul>

</li>




<li>
<a href="javascript:ShowHide('TimingDiv')">Controlling the speed of the camera when its traveling along the predefined path</a>
<div id="TimingDiv" style="display: none;">
	<ul>
	<li>
4.1 : To control the speed of the Cam is very important for good results. 
You have two possibilities to control the Cams movement speed when its following a camerapath. Both have advantages and disadvantages.
	</li>
	<li>
4.2 : Controlling the Speed manually:
When you activate the Cam with 'Numpad3' it will automatically put you 
in the Cam view and begins to travel along the path youve said with the pathnodes. The '1-9' and/or
'Numpad1/Numpad2' keys can be used to change the Cam's speed manually.
The advantage of this method is the full, manual control over the cams speed. But
speed changes have to be done dynamically and quickly in order to keep 
up with the gameplay sometimes.
	</li>
    <li>
4.3 : Controlling the speed automatically based on the campoints/pathnodes game time:
When you place a Campoint, its creation time is saved in order for the 
Cam to adjust its speed on its own.
In order to set up such a 'timed path', you not only have to take care 
of "where"  but also "when" to place a Campoint.
When the camera path is created, save it whith 'F6', reload the demo and
 the path('F8'), than hit 'J' to activate the automatic timing mode.
Then the demo should pause at the time you set the first Campoint. As 
soon as you unpause('ArrowDown') the demo, the camera will start its 
self-controlled path.

Notice that setting multiple Campoints while the demo is paused will 
break the timed path. If the Campoints are supposed to share the same 
time(since the demo is paused), the automatic timing won't work.

Sometimes it might happen that the Cam starts too soon or too late. In 
this case, you can pause the demo and synchronize the camera with the 
'Numpad+' and 'Numpad-' keys.
	</li>
	</ul>

<li>
<a href="javascript:ShowHide('lockcamprojectileDiv')">Locking the camera view</a>
<div id="lockcamprojectileDiv" style="display: none;">
	<ul>
	<li>
5.1 : 'L' locks the third person view of players and vehicles (on by default). This view mode replicates the original player inputs and
contains various enhancements for vehicle turrets, deployables etc.
	</li>
	<li>
5.2 : 'Numpad 6' locks the camera view onto a projectile. Cycle through 
the present projectiles with numpad 6. The spectating distance can be 
adjusted with the 'W' or 'S' keys. The camera movement speed can be 
changed with the '1-9' or 'numpad1/2' keys.
	</li>
	</ul>

</div> <!-- end lockcamprojectileDiv-->
</li>



<li>
<a href="javascript:ShowHide('deletingDiv')">Deleting cam points &amp; changing their positions</a>
<div id="deletingDiv" style="display: none;">
	<ul>
	<li>
6.1 : You can delete the last Campoint with 'Numpad4'. This way you also can delete the whole Campath or parts of it.
	</li>
	<li>
6.2 : You can correct the position of a Campoint with the 'Z' key. 
Firstly, select a Campoint with 'Numpad-/+', then switch back to the 
speccam ('right mouse button'), go to a new location and hit the 'Z' 
key. The Campoint's time for the 'timed path' mode will not be changed 
by this.
	</li>
	</ul>

</div> <!-- end deletingDiv-->
</li>



<li>
<a href="javascript:ShowHide('FOVDiv')">Changing Roll and Field-of-View(FOV)</a>
<div id="FOVDiv" style="display: none;">
	<ul>
	<li>
7.1 : If you want to make your Cam a littlebit more unique and dynamic 
you can assign different roll and field of view values for your 
Campoints.
	</li>
	<li>
7.2 : To do this, first select a Campoint with'Numpad-/+' and then you 
can use 'Numpad7/8' to change roll or fov. "Roll" means making the Cam 
lean left or right. By default 'Numpad7/8' will change roll. The 'O' key
 will cause 'Numpad7/8' to change the fov instead.
Note that "Roll" works only while paused at the moment, may be fixed in 
an update. 
	</li>
	</ul>

</div> <!-- end FOVDiv-->
</li>



<li>
<a href="javascript:ShowHide('patheditDiv')">Path edit mode</a>
<div id="patheditDiv" style="display: none;">
	<ul>
	<li>
8.1 : RypelCam will compute a smooth cam path between Campoints. In some
 situations you might want to change the way the Campoints are 
connected. For example if you placed the Campoints close to a wall, the 
resulting Campath might cut through the wall. 
With Pathedit mode you can change the bending of the path between 
selected cam points in order to turn sharper or softer. 
	</li>
	<li>
8.2 : First you have to hit 'F3' to enable the Pathedit mode. Select a 
Campoint with 'Numpad+' and 'Numpad-'. You can switch back to the free 
camera to keep track of the changes in the path. Finally, change the 
path with 'Numpad1' and 'Numpad2' 
	</li>
	</ul>
